## Final Thoughts for Round 1
### January 26, 2018

**A.K.A: _A Love Letter to my Twitter Fam_.**

Dear Fam,

This was a completely successful and highly effective challenge. It gave me a format to help me keep myself accountable. It brought out my best and helped me struggle through my worst - the self-doubt, frustration, and uncertainty that comes along with learning the skills to be a cutting edge developer today.

The Twitter community was the key. This challenge helped me connect with like-minded folks who are taking the same classes, learning the same information, and sharing support and direction at every turn.

Will Ferrell said it best when he said,
> **"Facebook makes you hate people you already know & Twitter makes you love people you've never met."**

That completely sums up my experience with this challenge. It was an exercise in commitment and consistency which ironically enough is the recipe for success in this field:

> **Consistency over time**.

If you can master that while leaning on the support of the community then you've got it made.

Thank you once again to Alexander Kallaway for providing access to this community and thank you to all the friends I've made during the seven months of coding it took me to get 100 Days of Log entries knocked out. :P :)

## 100. CSS Grid Practice App on CodePen
### Day 100: January,25 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** CSS Grid SPA

**Progress:** Completed project!

**Thoughts:** I had gotten a couple requests from folks about chekcing out the code - which anyone is free to do by [forking the repo](https://github.com/james-priest/grid-critters-code). So, since it's all straight HTML, CSS, & JS, I created a [Pen on CodePen](https://codepen.io/james-priest/pen/MrdNPZ) that you can check out as well.
